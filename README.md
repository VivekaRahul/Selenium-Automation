In this project, I developed automated test scripts using Java and Selenium WebDriver to test a web application. The main objective was to validate important functionalities such as user login, form submissions, and error handling.
I interacted with various web elements like input fields, buttons, and alerts to ensure that the application behaved correctly with both valid and invalid data.
I also verified whether proper error messages and validations appeared when wrong inputs were entered. This helped in identifying bugs and improving the overall quality and reliability of the application.
